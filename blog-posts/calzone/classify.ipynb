    "# What's in a name?  Predicting the Popularity of Posts by Title\n",
    "----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
    "When writing an article, blog, or post we all worry about whether others will read it, like it, or even share it.  I too suffer from this common anxiety; I want my writings to be popular!  I often wondered why my posts received less clicks/likes than another's.  On the surface, the only obvious differences were the title of the posts.  With this thought in mind, I began to formulate a hypothesis.  Maybe the title/name of a post correlates with its popularity?  If this is so, then maybe I can reverse-engineer the process and pick only popular titles.\n",
    "\n",
    "This leads us to the purpose of this article. The purpose of this article is to describe my efforts to predict whether or not a post to the [/r/datascience](https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience) subreddit will be popular. I define popularity as receiving more than the average number of upvotes.  I take a unique approach in making this prediction.  My prediction methodology is based solely on the title of the redditor's post, hence this blog's title: What's in a name?.  \n",
    "\n",
    "I will primarily be using two tools.  For visualization, I am excitedly using a package called [Yellowbrick](http://www.scikit-yb.org/en/latest/).  Yellowbrick rings true the phrase, a picture is worth a thousand words.  Yellowbrick's visuals can help you make quick interpretations of the performance of your machine learning model.  For model building, I am using the well-known [Sci-kit learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/) package.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will take four major steps to build our prediction model.  Firstly, we will obtain and preprocess our data.  Secondly, we will extract information/features from the titles, this includes things such as the number of vowels, consonants, and parts-of-speech.  Thirdly, we will perform the actual modeling which includes choosing an algorithm and generating a prediction model.  Fourthly, we will evaluate the performance of the model and explore how to fine-tune it.   \n",

    "1.  Reads in csv-formatted subreddit data.  \n",
    "    1a. You can use the grab_posts function within [calzone.py](code/calzone.py) to collect posts inline\n",
    "2.  Optional: Data manipulation  \n",
    "    2a. Obtain normal distribution of votes by applying log transformation.  \n",
    "    2b. Remove outliers using z-scores greater than -2.5 and less than 2.5\n",
    "3.  Create labeled data (It is the boolean set to whether or not a title will be popular )\n",
    "4.  Split data into training and test \n",
    "\n",
    "### The First Steps!\n",
    "The first step of predicting the success of a post was grabbing [/r/datascience](https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience) submissions.  I provide several years' worth of [data](data/processed_datascience.csv.bz2) below, however, you can grab your own data by using the script [calzone.py](code/calzone.py) \n",
    "\n",
    "The second step is to clean up the data.  This can include removing characters or changing the case of words in the titles but most importantly it included dealing specifically with the number of votes that each title received.  We noticed that there were votes that were wildly different than the rest.  To handle these anomalies we removed the outliers based on z-scores.  We then log transformed the votes in order to obtain a normal distribution.  In the histogram below you can see that without normalization the number of votes is left-skewed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thirdly, we specified the target.  The target is the class that is being predicted.  In our case, we are trying to predict whether or not a post receives greater than the average number of votes (SUCCESS!).  For this dataset, the average is 7.5 votes.\n",

    "The titles provide us with two different types of information.  The first type is the general attributes of the title; i.e. how many words, syllables, vowels, etc... (see above for list of attributes) in each title.  The second type is the words themselves.  The question is how do we use both types of information to predict if a title will be successful.  For the attributes, it is simple because they are numbers; it could be as easy as finding out which combination of attributes define success versus failure.  How to define success with just words becomes tricky.  Essentially, performing machine learning on the titles requires that the text content be turned into numerical feature vectors(feature extraction).  \n",
    "\n",
    "For feature extraction on the titles, we used a count vectorizer that measures term frequency(tf); i.e. how often a word appears in a title.  For instance, if we do this for the following sentences, then we produce the matrix below.  \n",

    "The downside of just using tf is that words that appear most often tend to dominate the matrix.  To overcome this, we used the product of term frequency and inverse document frequency(tf-idf).  Idf is the measure of whether a term is common or rare across all documents [Side note 2]. \n",
    "\n",
    "Essentially, tf-idf creates a word vector in which a word is weighted by its occurence not only in the title it was derived from, but also the corpus (the entire group of titles). A complete example on how tf-idf is calculated can be found [here](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/lwgray/ddl/blob/master/blog-posts/calzone/tfidf.ipynb).\n",
    "\n",
    "The tf-idf process leaves us with about a vocabulary of 58,000 (see side note, for explanation of why this is so large).  Not all these words/phrases are going to provide useful information.  The trick is to find a reduced dimensional representation of our matrix that emphasizes the strongest relationships and throws away the noise.  To achieve this, we use a dimension reduction technique called TruncatedSVD aka Latent Semantic Analysis[(LSA)](https://technowiki.wordpress.com/2011/08/27/latent-semantic-analysis-lsa-tutorial/).  After reducing our dimensions with LSA, we further compact our matrix by using Anova F-Value feature selection.\n",

    "Let's not forget about the title attributes, they also need to undergo feature selection.  We did this by using tree-based estimators(ExtraTreesClassifier) to compute feature importance, which can be used to discard irrelevant features.  This resulted in a reduction from 45 to 17 most important attributes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using Sci-kit Learn's \"feature union\" function, we combined the attribute and tf-idf vectors then inserted this vector into a Random Forest Classifier.  We chose Random Forest only after trying out several other classifers, such as Naive Bayes, Multilayer Perceptron, and K Nearest Neighbors.  We optimized our model by tuning the [hyperparameters](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/lwgray/ddl/blob/master/blog-posts/calzone/hyperparameters.ipynb).\n",
    "We evaluated our model with common scoring methods; Our accuracy was 55%.  The charts below provide more visual evaluations.

    "## Experimentation\n",
    "To test our model in the wild, we input different titles into the model then chose a title that was predicted to be \"Popular\".  Our chosen title was \"A tutorial on my machine-learning workflow for predicting whether or not a post will be popular!\"  Next, I published this exact article(the one you are currently reading) to r/datascience, r/machinelearning, and r/python subreddits.  The results after a couple of days were astonishing, the datascience subreddit post received 17 votes while machinelearning and python only got 0 and 1 votes respectively.  You might be confused by the zeor/one votes but the model worked as it was built for. The r/machinelearning and r/python postings were meant as controls since our model was built specifically for r/datascience subreddit.  The 17 votes may not seem like a lot of votes, but you need to take into consideration that unpopular posts in /r/datascience receive on average 2 votes. \n",

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "It is known that day and time are powerful predictors of votes (likes, retweets) but by not confining/limiting my predictions to these temporal parameters I will be able to show that an underlying structure exists that correlates titles to upvotes.  My goal was to go through and document the entire process of building a classifier.  I learned a lot.  Now, I know that a Reddit title isn't sufficient enough to predict whether or not a post will be successful.  Getting to this conclusion after so many hours of work was heartbreaking but at the same time very fulfilling.  I hope you can take my failure and use it to build successful models.  Also, I hope you will return for my follow-up blog post on how to predict the number of votes a title will receive.  Until next time, Adios :)\n",
