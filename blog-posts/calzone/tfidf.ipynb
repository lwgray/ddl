    "The downside of just using tf is that words that appear most often tend to dominate the vector.  To overcome this we use a combination of term frequency - inverse document frequency(tf-idf).  Idf is measure of whether a term is common or rare across all documents [Side note 2].  Idf is the log of one plus the number of documents(N) divided by the number of documents a term(n) appears in.  The one is present so that the equation doesn't evaluate to zero.\n",
